Monitoring leaf water content with THz and sub-THz waves

This research project focuses on monitoring the water content of leaves using THz and sub-THz waves. The project involves utilizing various algorithms, such as KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM, to analyze the data collected from the leaves. Additionally, an ensemble learning approach was proposed as a novel method to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis.

The primary goal of this project was to develop a non-invasive, efficient, and accurate method for assessing leaf water content. To achieve this goal, we acquired data using THz and sub-THz waves and then applied various machine learning algorithms to analyze this data. After analyzing the performance of each algorithm, we proposed an ensemble learning approach that combines multiple algorithms into a single model to improve the accuracy and robustness of the analysis.

By conducting this research, we have contributed to the development of an innovative and practical method for monitoring leaf water content using THz and sub-THz waves. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed ensemble learning approach outperforms the other algorithms, achieving a higher accuracy with faster processing time.

Overall, this project highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms and THz/sub-THz waves for non-invasive monitoring of leaf water content.
